The 40% of users never adopts the suggested Assistive Technology while the 18% stops using it within 6 months and it is often not related to the properties of the  device.

Patients (and mostly the young ones) can reach meaningful improvements of their skills ONLY IF the healthcare system is able to follow them and adapt the clinical program to their needs in a quick and effective way.

People with cognitive and physical impairments has to follow complex programs that require a lot of treatments. Those experts involved have few or any chance to share each other their experience with the patient and it is really difficult to validate the program, and refine it to be coherent with the patient needs.

Let’s think to a child unable to speech: it could mean he will learn a lower amount of words and concepts and so he will acquire a reduced capability to express himself.

This is why the solution is designed to spread the communication among all the subjects involved in a rehabilitation or enablement program. 
Based on the usage of the mobile app, the solution allows to collect data about the experience of the patient during the program 
and it enables the definition of a shared knowledge on the patient experience.

The designed system:
- has a reduced impact because it needs each user spend just one minute to answer few questions
- enables experts and caregivers to share knowledges on the patient response to the program
- can alert experts if something is, possibly, going wrong
- works well also if just few users share their perception 
- can be used to collect useful content the family can use to better understand the program and the impairments, and find activities to do at home to encourage skills development

It is easy to understand how powerful this kind of system can be and how much it can boost the success of the program and support the families now and when this crisis will end up
